Early warning systems for infectious diseases have the potential to flag outbreaks to public health authorities months in advance. This can help facilitate a targeted response to epidemic mitigation, directing healthcare resources to regions within a country that need them most. I took part in a research collaboration between universities and public health organisations in Northern Ireland and Vietnam, where we developed weather-based forecasting models to help improve public health responses to dengue fever and diarrhoea in Vietnam. 

Our work on dengue fever has been published [here](https://journals.plos.org/plosntds/article?id=10.1371/journal.pntd.0010509). However, I have also written a [blog post on our work on diarrhoea](/blog/climate-sensitive-diseases/). This is intended to open up our work to a broader audience by focusing on the key context and results from our paper while minimising any technical jargon.
