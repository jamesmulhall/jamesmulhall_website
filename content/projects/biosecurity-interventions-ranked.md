Global Catastrophic Biological Risks (GCBRs) pose a significant threat to humanity's long term potential. In order to better assess which of these risks deserve the most attention, a colleague and I have set out to rank major GCBRs using an Importance-Tractability-Neglectedness (ITN) framework. Once complete, the findings will be made available here on my website, the [Effective Altruism (EA) Forum](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/), and possibly additional sources. We also aim to publicise our results by engaging with journalists to reach an audience beyond the existing EA community. Given the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, the general public may be more open to considering the risks associated with GCBRs and developing an interest in EA.

#### Project Goals:
- Increase awareness of the importance, tractability, and neglectedness of GCBRs
- Spark discussion of the relative ranking of GCBRs
- Invite more people into the EA community through media coverage of GCBR rankings
