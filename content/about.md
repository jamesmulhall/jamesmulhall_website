Hi, I'm James. I'm passionate about effective altruism, pandemic preparedness, biosecurity, and general priorities research. I have academic and professional experience in infectious disease modelling â€” you can check out some of my projects [here](/projects) and the blog posts explaining them [here](/blog).

If you'd like to collaborate on a project, talk about effective altruism, or reach out for another reason, please feel free to [contact me](/contact) and I'll get back to you shortly. I'm especially interested in projects to do with:
 - Disease modelling
 - General priorities research
 - Comparing EA interventions that have not been heavily compared yet (e.g., ranking    biosecurity interventions)
 - Presenting complex EA interventions in simple ways to make them easier to understand
 - Founding an EA-focused start-up
